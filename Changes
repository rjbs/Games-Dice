Revision history for Games-Die

0.07_01  2004-09-18
         beginning of result class

0.06

0.05
         minor bug in adjust behavior
				 Push adjust value onto roll() return list only if adjust is non-zero,
				 instead of always pushing it as before (Ricardo)

0.04
         fixed minus-one bug, added +/- modfifiers

				 Fixed bug where a die would never roll its maximum value.  I
				 introduced this in 0.03 somehow and never caught it.  I thought I had
				 a grasp on basic arithmetic by now...

				 Added Ricardo Signes' +/-N adjustment to "d" style specifier (e.e.
				 2d8+1)

0.03
         fixed random number generation
				 Wrote Die::roll the right way so there is no longer a limit to the
				 number of sides (thanks to Thomas R. Sibley).  I am dumb.  :)

0.02
         added D&D dice specification, Dice::roll, documentation
         Increased die side limit from 100 to 10000 and documented the limit
         Added documentation for Games::Die::Dice
				 Games::Die::Dice now supports "D&D style" die descriptors in its
				 constructor (such as "2d8" or "6d20")
				 Games::Die::Dice::roll now returns the sum of the roll in scalar
				 context, as one would expect!

0.01
         initial release
